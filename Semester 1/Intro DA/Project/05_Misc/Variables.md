<sup>1</sup>: Snow is not reported because only on January 24 and 25 2021 it was reported to be > 0mm

<sup>3</sup>: 
General
The data that is included in the calculation depends on user settings, connectivity and whether it meets Googles privacy threshold. If the privacy threshold isn’t met (when somewhere isn’t busy enough to ensure anonymity) we don’t show a change for the day. 
Insights are calculated based on data from users who have opted in to Location History for their Google Account, so that the data represents a sample of the users. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behaviour of a wider population. The way to calculate changes for groceries and pharmacy, retail and recreation, public transport stations and parks categories was updated. For regions published before May 2020, the data may contain a consistent shift (up or down) which starts between 11–18 April 2020. 

Baseline
The data shows how visitors to (or time spent in) categorized places change compared to our baseline days. A baseline day represents a normal value for that day of the week. The baseline day is the median value from the 5‑week period Jan 3 – Feb 6, 2020.

For each region-category, the baseline isn’t a single value—it’s 7 individual values. The same number of visitors on 2 different days of the week, result in different percentage changes.

To help track week-to-week changes, the baseline days never change. These baseline days also don't account for seasonality. For example, visitors to parks typically increase as the weather improves.

Long-term analysis
As time passes and we move further away from the baseline period, populations might vary due to relocation or new regional and remote working options. Google’s understanding of categorized places might also change. For example, the same value today and in April 2020 might not indicate the same behavior or adherence—it might be that Google has updated information about shops and restaurants in the region or that fewer people live there now. These differences could shift the values up or down over long time periods, so we recommend using some caution when analyzing data from longer time intervals (6+ months).

<sup>4</sup>: People typically work for 8 hours a day. Because there are only 24 hours in a day, the largest change possible on a working day might only be +50% and even less on weekends.

<sup>5</sup>: “The details: we continue to measure the overall impact of COVID-19 on the industry by showing seated diners at a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels (online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins) in regions or metros with 50+ restaurants on the OpenTable network.
As of March 2021, we’ve updated the dataset from January 1, 2021 onward to compare seated diners from 2021 to 2019. This represents seated diners across all channels from the same sample of restaurants. While COVID-19 has had a significant impact on restaurant closures, this data does not account for the changes in the number of restaurants on our platform in a given area. As of April 28, 2021, for the displayed datasets percentages are rounded down. For a complete view, download the dataset.
For year-over-year comparisons, we continue to compare the same day of the week in 2020-21 to the same day of the week in 2019 (not the same date). For example, we’d compare Tuesday of week 11 in 2021 to Tuesday of week 11 in 2019.To better reflect the state of the industry overall, this dataset is based on a sample of approximately 20,000 restaurants that provide OpenTable with information on all of their inventory in states or metros with 50+ restaurants on the OpenTable network. This sample of restaurants typically accounts for a majority of our seated online reservations.”
